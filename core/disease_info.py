    'Corn (maize) - Cercospora leaf spot Gray leaf spot': {
        'crop': 'Corn',
        'disease': 'Grey Leaf Spot',
        'cause': 'Gray leaf spot lesions on corn leaves hinder photosynthetic activity, reducing carbohydrates allocated towards grain fill. The extent to which gray leaf spot damages crop yields can be estimated based on the extent to which leaves are infected relative to grainfill.',
        'prevention': [
            'Reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion by limiting secondary disease cycles.',
            'Protect leaf area from damage until after corn grain formation.',
            'Avoid high-risk factors like continuous corn planting and late planting dates.'

        'crop': 'Tomato',
        'disease': 'Early Blight',
        'cause': 'Caused by the fungus Alternaria solani, which survives in debris or soil. It thrives in warm, humid conditions.',
        'prevention': [
            'Use pathogen-free seed and rotate crops every 2-3 years.',
            'Maintain vigor by proper fertilization and avoid overhead irrigation.',
            'Apply fungicides if weather conditions favor disease development.'

        'disease': 'Late Blight',
        'cause': 'Caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. It is famous for causing the Irish Potato Famine.',
        'prevention': [
            'Eliminate cull piles and volunteer potatoes.',
            'Use certified disease-free tubers.',
            'Apply protective fungicides before infection occurs.'
